This open source script is as a part of the manuscript “Numerical Homogenization Study on the Effects of Columnar Jointed Structure on the Mechanical Properties of Rock Mass”. It is a python script incorporated with the ABAQUS. This short script can generate the RVE model not only for FEM code like ABAQUS, but also for DEM code like UDEC and PFC with or without periodicity. This code can be helpful for the related analysis in this topic. 

If you want to use these codes, Please kindly cite the following articles:
